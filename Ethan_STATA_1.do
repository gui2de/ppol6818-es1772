/*
Q1: As part of a larger examination of how various factors contribute to student achievement, you have been asked to find a couple of pieces of information about a school district. Unfortunately, the relevant data is spread across four different files (student.dta, teacher.dta, school.dta, and subject.dta all in the following subfolder: q1_data. See the readme file for more details regarding each dataset.

*Q2: You are working on a crop insurance project in Kenya. For each household, we have the following information: village name, pixel and payout status.




use $q2_village, replace

*a)	Payout variable should be consistent within a pixel, confirm if that is the case. Create a new dummy variable (pixel_consistent), this variable =0 if payout variable isn't consistent within that pixel (i.e. =1 when all the payouts are exactly the same, =0 if there is even a single different payout in the pixel) 
bysort pixel: gen pixel_consistent = (payout[_N] == payout[1])

tab pixel_consistent
*yep that is correct 

*b)	Usually the households in a particular village are within the same pixel but it is possible that some villages are in multiple pixels (boundary cases). Create a new dummy variable (pixel_village), =0 for the entire village when all the households from the village are within a particular pixel, =1 if households from a particular village are in more than 1 pixel. Hint: This variable is at village level.

egen check = tag(village pixel)
egen ndistinct_vil = total(check), by(village)
gen pixel_village = (ndistinct_vil > 1)
drop check ndistinct_vil // these were just needed to count 
list village if pixel_village == 1

/* c)	For this experiment, it is only an issue if villages are in different pixels AND have different payout status. For this purpose, divide the households in the following three categories:
i.	Villages that are entirely in a particular pixel. (==1)
ii.	Villages that are in different pixels AND have same payout status (Create a list of all hhids in such villages) (==2)
iii.	Villages that are in different pixels AND have different payout status (==3)
Hint: These 3 categories are mutually exclusive AND exhaustive i.e. every single observation should fall in one of the 3 categories. Note also that the categories may or may not line up with what you created in (a) and (b) so read the instructions closely.

/*Q3: Faculty members submitted 128 proposals for funding opportunities. Unfortunately, we only have enough funding for 50 grants. Each proposal was assigned randomly to three selected reviewers who each gave a score between 1 (lowest) and 5 (highest). Each person reviewed 24 proposals and assigned a score. We think it will be better if we normalize the score wrt each reviewer (using unique ids) before calculating the average score. Add the following columns 1) stand_r1_score 2) stand_r2_score 3) stand_r3_score 4) average_stand_score 5) rank (Note: highest score =>1, lowest => 128)
Hint: We can normalize scores using the following formula: (score â€“ mean)/sd, where mean = mean score of that particular reviewer (based on the netid), sd = standard deviation of scores of that particular reviewer (based on that netid). (Hint: we are not standardizing the score wrt reviewer 1, 2 or 3. But by the netID.)
