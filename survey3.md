I have uploaded the results of the ietestform: the outstanding issues are not issues. First its not reading correctly that they will be integer values and not strings for TEST: NON NUMERIC NAME VALUES. Then for TEST: NON-REQUIRED NON-NOTE TYPE FIELD I have to let you skip otherwise you can't complete the survey on a computer as it will not be able to send an sms.
